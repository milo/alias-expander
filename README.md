AliasExpander
=============
It is a tool for run-time class alias expanding to its fully qualified name. In brief, it is a workaround for missing `::class` constant from PHP 5.5 in PHP 5.3+ and a helper for annotations processing.

This repository is automatically updated from [Milo\Utils](https://github.com/milo/utils). In that repository, you can find a [documentation](https://github.com/milo/utils#aliasexpander), [tests](https://github.com/milo/utils/tree/master/tests/Utils) and [issues](https://github.com/milo/utils/issues) for this one.

The reason for repo splitting is to provide single class for composer and simultaneously simplify the maintainance of these single-purpose classes.
